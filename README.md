## Process
To create this Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard, I started by collecting raw data related to product sales, categories, and customer reviews from Amazon datasets. The data was first cleaned and structured using Power Query in Power BI, where unnecessary fields were removed, column types were standardized, and missing values were handled. After the initial cleaning, I performed data modeling by establishing relationships between key fields such as Product Category, Sales, Time (Month & Week), and Reviews. Next, I developed key performance indicators (KPIs) like Year-To-Date (YTD) Sales, Quarter-To-Date (QTD) Sales, Total Units Sold, and Total Reviews using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). For better data understanding, I designed various interactive visualizations including bar charts, line graphs, and tables to represent monthly and weekly trends, product performance by category, and top-performing products by sales and reviews. Slicers were added to allow dynamic filtering based on Product Category and Region. Once the dashboard was finalized, I tested its responsiveness and readability, ensuring it delivered meaningful insights. The project highlights effective use of Power BI for real-time data analysis and business intelligence reporting.

## Dashboard


## 
*Women customers are more likely to buy products compared to men (~65%).

*The states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 product buyers.

*The adult age group (30-49 yrs) is max contributing (~50%) and buys the most products.

*The maximum number of products customer orders from Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels.

*More than 90% of the products delivered

## Final Conclusion:
To improve the sales of Vrinda Store, a strategic marketing plan focused on women aged 30-49 years residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh should be implemented. This demographic represents a key consumer segment, as they often make significant household and lifestyle purchases. The approach should include targeted digital marketing campaigns and personalized promotions to capture their attention.
